bubble sort
name comes from the fact the bubbles in water reach the top, similarily here we push the heavier elements to the right

for n-1 times
traverse from left to right, repeatedly swap consecutive elements so that the
heaviest element in the current array moves to the last of the current array
as heavier elements reach to the last array size decreases by one

in the first iteration the heaviest element gets pushed to last index and array on which we need to operate decrease by one 
in the second iteration the second heaviest element get pushed to the second last index and array on which we need to operate decrease by one 

worst, best and avg case time = o(n^2)
space = o(1)
best case => array is already sorted, if we optimize then best case time = o(n) when array is fully sorted, optimization is done by using swapped flag, if we remove that optimization is removed
worst case => array is sorted in descending order
stable: yes => consider a case with two elements with value at 8 at indices
3 and 6, the 8 present at index 3 wont ever cross 8 present at index 6 because
the if condition doesnot have any equality sign

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

insertion sort

array is divided into two regions sorted and unsorted, unsorted region starts from i, traverse from left to right, we need to insert the first element of
unsorted region at its correct index by shifting the sorted array towards right (not by swapping even though it could give the same result)

time same as bubble sort for all cases, also the best case and worst case scenarios are same, we dont need to make any optimization for the best case because in the best case there will be no shifting possible so only outer loop runs

in all cases other than the best case, both the loop runs till their bounds
even though swapping occurs or not
only the best case the outer loop runs once so time = o(n)

stable: yes => consider a case with two elements with value at 2 at indices
4 and 5, and  elements to the left are greater than 2, then the 2 present at index 4 will react to the first position and the one at 5 will react at the
second position from left and wont cross the other element with value 2

bubble sort and insertion sort use consecutive swapping or shifting that's why
they are stable

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
selection sort

array is divided into two areas sorted and unsorted, unsorted region starts with i, every time find the index of minimum element from the the unsorted area and put it at last of sorted area by swapping

so we need n-1 iterations

Best, average and worst case time complexity: n^2 which is independent of distribution of data. 
space = o(1)

stable: no => because here we are swapping distant elements unlike bubble and insertion sort

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Merge sort â€“ 
Best, average and worst case time complexity: nlogn which is independent of distribution of data. 
stable: yes => it could be made stable, rearrangement of elements takes place while merging so we need to make chngs there, while we put the elements into
the big array, we select the minmum b/n the two there we have

so if(a[i]<=b[j]) {
    i think that :here we must use equality sign also, so that even if two  elements are equal
    a[i] goes first because a[i] was left to b[j] because 'a' array is left to b
    that's it
} else {
    
}
 

Several common sorting algorithms are stable by nature, such as Merge Sort, Timsort, Counting Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort. Others such as Quicksort, Heapsort and Selection Sort are unstable.


bubble, insertion, count, merge sort -> stable
selection, quick sort -> unstable

comparision based: bubble, insertion, selection, merge sort
non comparision based: radix, count sort

placement course

divide and conquer recursive algo

algo:
choose a pivot(same for always) here we choose last element always 
partition the array around the pivot, ie all smaller elements on the left of pivot and all larger elements to the right of pivot
now recursively sort the left and right regions of pivot

algorithm for partition is important to look

i haven't used the partitioning algo from apna college
i have used the algo used for the standard problem from the pepcoding youtube video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if40LxQ8_Xo 

algo: 

i to n-1 => unknown region or the region on which we are operating 
j to i-1 => elements greater than pivot
0 to j-1 => elements lesser than pivot

here i is being incremented inside the for loop
code by sumit sir increments i inside the while loop body

best and avg case time comp = o(nlogn)

worst case time comp = o(n^2), this occurs when the given array is already asc or desc sorted, and the pivot is always the smallest or largest element

consider a case when given array is already sorted and pivot is the last element ie the largest one, in such case when we partition all the n-1 elements other than the last element will go in one partition and we will apply quick sort on an array of n-1 size, so we were just able to remove one element after partioning

best and avg cases include when partitioning happens such that the array gets divided into two equal sized arrays like in merge sort

Though the worst-case complexity of quicksort is more than other sorting algorithms such as Merge sort and Heap sort, still it is faster in practice. Worst case in quick sort rarely occurs because by changing the choice of pivot, it can be implemented in different ways. Worst case in quicksort can be avoided by choosing the right pivot element.

Space Complexity	O(n*logn)
stable: no => because here we are swapping distant elements unlike bubble and insertion sort
