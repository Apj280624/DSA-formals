Quantiphi:
Could not solve one coding problem because I had only 15 mins left to solve it. So I thought of solving mcqs rather. 
But they selected some student based on ML background or sectional performance or two coding problems but not on overall test performance.

Josh soft:
In first coding test:
there server created the problem: I solved the first which was very easy but when i submitted it, it showed server error and when
i tried to submit it multiple times because of server error it showed submission limit exceeded
in the second problem, which was the coin change problem, the student who submitted the greedy solution got AC but I submitted the correct DP solution and got WA
there testing code must be wrong
third problem was wrong too i think, but i could not submit this one too
retest was taken:
I solved all three in 30 mins, but they fulfilled their requirement from the first test itself and a lot of students like me who solved all the prblms were not 
shortlisted
in the first test 50 shortlisted, in the retest only 5 shortlisted, somebody told me the 2nd shortlist was based on cgpa

deqode:
written test: i solved both of the questions(a lot of students did): ques were one easy and one medium(variation of generate all partitions of a string)
but some how not shortlisted in those 30

infosys:
tough exam:
clueless about first que based on mathematical expectations topic
2nd one's some part wanted me to write a better implementation of longest pallindromic substring than the DP, has to used manacher's algo saw william lin's solution
still 2nd did not pass
3rd one i though i wrote the optimal solution and though it was correct during the whole test, due to being sure of its correctness i wasted all my time in it
later submitted a non optimal solution and some test cases passed. later i realized at home that the optimal solution was wrong and i could have used that time
to debug the 2nd que

sap: 
even though i did not want to get selected but i got rejected
solved 2 coding ques, but c++ and java mcqs might have been wrong
