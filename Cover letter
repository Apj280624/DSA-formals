Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to be applying for the Engineering Internship at GitLab. I am a final year Computer Science student working everyday towards becoming better at Software Development irrespective of tech stacks. I am more than ready to learn from the brilliant minds in the company and contribute to the company with my entire potential and knowledge.

I am currently involved in learning Web development technologies like React, MongoDB, NodeJs and I have also worked in Android development using Java previously. Apart from this I focus on my problem solving skills using Data structures and Algorithms and regularily participate in programming contests and have secured exceptional ranks in  some of them.

I am very thankful for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to learning more about the company. As a Software Developer, my goal is to continually 
improve my programming skills in order to present better solutions to my employers. I am greatly moved by the mission GitLab has, and I too believe in it.

Sincerely,

Apoorv Jain
