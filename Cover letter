Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to be applying for the Engineering Internship at GitLab. I am a final year Computer Science student working everyday towards becoming 
better at Software Development irrespective of tech stacks. I am more than ready to learn from the brilliant minds in the company and contribute 
to the company with my entire potential and knowledge.

I am currently involved in learning Web development technologies like React, MongoDB, NodeJs and I have also worked in Android development using
Java previously. Apart from this I focus on my problem solving skills using Data structures and Algorithms and regularily participate in programming
contests and have secured exceptional ranks in  some of them.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to learning more about the company. As a Software Developer, my goal is to continually 
improve my programming skills in order to present better solutions to my employers. I am greatly moved by the mission GitLab has, and I too believe in it.

Sincerely,

Apoorv Jain
